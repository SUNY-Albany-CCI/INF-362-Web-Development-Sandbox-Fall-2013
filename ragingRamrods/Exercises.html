	  <p>1.Barbell bench press</p>
	  <p>Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip that creates a 90-degree angle 
	    in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms, lift the bar from 
	    the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. Breathe in and begin coming 
	    down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest. After a brief pause, push the bar 
	    back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your 
	    chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the 
	    top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. </p>

	  <p>2.Barbell incline bench press</p>
	  <p>Lie back on an incline bench. Using a medium-width a grip that creates a 90-degree 
	    angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms, lift the bar 
	    from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. As you breathe in, 
	    come down slowly until you feel the bar on you upper chest. After a second pause, bring 
	    the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your chest
	    muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, squeeze your chest, hold for a second 
	    and then start coming down slowly again.</p>

	  <p>3.Dumbbell bench press</p>
	  <p>Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. 
	    The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help raise 
	    the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of 
	    you at shoulder width. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms 
	    of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your 
	    chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90-degree angle. Be sure to maintain full 
	    control of the dumbbells at all times. Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the 
	    dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second 
	    and then begin coming down slowly. </p>

	  <p>4.Dumbbell flys</p>
	  <p>Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The 
	    palms of your hand will be facing each other. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, 
	    lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the 
	    palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop 
	    and hold just before you lock out. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at 
	    the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your 
	    chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Return your arms back to the starting 
	    position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. </p>

	  <p>5.Cable cross over</p>
	  <p>Place the pulleys on a high position above your head, select the resistance to be used and hold the 
	    pulleys in each hand. Step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while 
	    pulling your arms together in front of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. 
	    With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, extend your arms to 
	    the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. </p>

	  <p>1.Seated barbell military press</p>
	  <p>Sit on a Military Press Bench with a bar behind your head palms facing forward. Lift the bar up 
	    over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. 
	    Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale. Lift the bar back up to the starting position 
	    as you exhale.</p>

	  <p>2.One arm dumbbell row</p>
	  <p>Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it. Place the right leg on top of the end of 
	    the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place 
	    your right hand on the other end of the bench for support. Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the 
	    floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your 
	    torso. Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side 
	    and keeping the torso stationary. </p>

	  <p>3.Neutral grip pull-ups</p>
	  <p>Take a hold of the bar from each side and hang from it. Stick your chest out and lean yourself back 
	    slightly in order to better engage the lats. Using your lats, pull your torso up while leaning your head 
	    back slightly so that you do not hit yourself with the chin-up bar. Continue until your chest nearly 
	    touches the bar. Exhale as you execute this motion. After a second hold on the contracted position, 
	    slowly lower your body back to the starting position as you breathe in.</p>

	  <p>4.Middle back shrug</p>
	  <p>Lie facedown on an incline bench while holding a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be fully 
	    extended hanging down and pointing towards the floor. The palms of your hands should be facing each 
	    other. As you exhale, squeeze your shoulder blades together and hold the contraction for a full second. </p>
	  <p><img border="0" src="http://54.221.244.79/~alebron/exercise%20pics/back_4a.png" alt="back_4a" width="150" height="150">, <img border="0" src="http://54.221.244.79/~alebron/exercise%20pics/back_4b.png" alt="back_4b" width="150" height="150"></p>
	  
	  <p>5.Barbell deadlift</p>
	  <p>Stand in front of a loaded barbell. While keeping the back as straight as possible, bend your knees, 
	    bend forward and grasp the bar using a medium (shoulder width) overhand grip. While holding the bar, 
	    start the lift by pushing with your legs while simultaneously getting your torso to the upright position 
	    as you breathe out. In the upright position, stick your chest out and contract the back by bringing the 
	    shoulder blades back. Go back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously 
	    leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight. </p>

	  <p>1.Back squat</p>
	  <p>Grab the barbell with a grip slightly wider than shoulder width, step under the bar, and place it 
	    across your upper back just below the top of your trapezius. Be sure to keep your shoulder blades pulled 
	    tightly together and maintain a tight upper back throughout the lift. After stepping out of the rack, 
	    initiate the movement by pushing your hips behind you. Keep your chest up and maintain an arched back 
	    while lowering yourself until the crease of your hip is lower than the top of your knee. Allow me to 
	    repeat that: lower than the top of your knee. Strongly reverse the movement until back to the starting 
	    position.</p>

	  <p>2.Front squat</p>
	  <p>Grab a barbell with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Swing your elbows under the bar until 
	    they are pointing forward and the barbell rests across your shoulders in front of you. Keep your elbows 
	    pointed forward throughout the movement. Squat while keeping your weight on your heels. Keep your chest 
	    and elbows up.</p>

	  <p>3.Leg extensions</p>
	  <p>For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on 
	    the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the sidebars. Make 
	    sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. Using your quadriceps, extend 
	    your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Pause a second on the contracted position. Slowly lower the weight 
	    back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.</p>

	  <p>4.Leg press</p>
	  <p>Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front

	  <p>3.Triceps pull downs</p>
	  <p>Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). 
	    Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms 
	    close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the 
	    pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. Using the triceps, bring the rope 
	    down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the 
	    arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. </p>
